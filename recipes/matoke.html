    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p> Making Matoke is super easy. Here are some simple steps you have to follow: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the bananas; then cut them into two-inch pieces and place them inside salted water to avoid
            discoloration when they come into contact with air.</li>

        <li>Place a saucepan over medium heat and add avocado oil to it. Once the oil is hot, add chopped onion
            and
            cook for about 2 minutes or until they are translucent and soft. Next, garlic, ginger, bell pepper, and
            tomatoes
            and continue to cook for 2 more minutes.</li>

        <li>Now, add curry powder, cayenne pepper, bouillon cube, and cilantro, and mix well. Cook for a minute
            or
            two until spices are fragrant.</li>

        <li>Add the green bananas and mix well.</li>

        <li>Pour water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil and cover the saucepan with a lid. Reduce the heat
            and
            let the mixture simmer for about 25 minutes or until the green bananas are tender.</li>

        <li>Serve. </li>

    </ol>
